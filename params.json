Thinking in fractions allows for infinite columns and nesting. No matter the context, fractions are **always** true.\r\n\r\nUse a common denominator to stay on a specific grid (e.g. 1/2, 1/6, 1/12) - or wander off-grid in a heartbeat with non-divisable fractions (e.g. 1/5, 1/7).\r\n\r\nInspired by http://builtbyboon.com/blog/proportional-grids\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
